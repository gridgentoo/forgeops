=====================
Notice of Deprecation
=====================

# What's Changed:

  The script `bin/cdk` is being replaced by `bin/forgeops`. This new script will manage both CDK and CDM deployments.

# How does this impact me?

  * The script `bin/cdk` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. 
  * You should promptly apply necessary updates to any scripts using `bin/cdk`.
  * Start using `bin/forgeops` to install and delete CDK deployments.

# What should I use to deploy the ForgeRock CDK?

  Please use `bin/forgeops install --cdk` instead. Command arguments used by `bin/cdk`
  continue to be supported in `bin/forgeops`.
  By default, `bin/forgeops install` and `bin/forgeops generate` will target CDK deployments.
