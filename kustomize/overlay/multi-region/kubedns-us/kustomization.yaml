# The new name must match the 'subdomain' value in the corresponding StatefulSet (in 'patchesStrategicMerge' section)

# There are two main settings to pay attention to in this section
# 1) In each StatefulSet, the subdomain ('spec.template.spec.subdomain') must correspond to the service name, which includes
#    the region as a suffix
# 2) In each StatefulSet, the DS_BOOTSTRAP_REPLICATION_SERVERS must be set to match the FQDN of the DS bootstrap servers
#    Note that in a multi-region setting, the FQDN has the following format: '[serverName].[serviceName].[namespace].svc.cluster.local'
#         where serverName is built using number as a suffix, for example: 'ds-cts-0', 'ds-cts-1', ..., 'ds-cts-n'
#         where serviceName is built using the region as a suffix, for example 'ds-cts-europe' or 'ds-cts-us'
